05 - DIY IoT Challenge!
========================

Now its time to test your IoT skills, and see if you can build a working end-to-end IoT solution that will measure **temperature, humidity, and light levels**, and send that data from your IoTanium board to AWS using MQTT.

Here are some hints to help you get started:

- Use the ``hello_world.py`` you used in section :doc:`../iot_hello_world/iot_hello_world` as a base for your script, as it already has a working MQTT client that sends data to the cloud.  You just need to change what data it sends!

- You will need to replace the hello world data in that script, with temp, humidity and light data.  Use what you learned in section :doc:`../sensors/sensors` to figure out how to do this.

- Pay attention, the ``hello_world.py`` script is missing a library you need to read one of your sensors! Inspect what you previously did to read the sensors successfully, and add any missing libraries to the ``import`` section at the top of your script.

- Leave the ``topic`` values unchanged in your script.  That is, similar to::

   iotsample/company_name/team_name/data

- You have completed the challenge successfully when your device is sending json data like that shown below, to the same AWS IoT endpoint as before.  Note that the **time** and **thingId** fields are required, and are already correctly populated in the commented out example in ``hello_world.py``::

   >>> import my_script
    published to topic iotsample/company_name/team_name/data: {"thingId": thingId,"time": 600,"temperature": '21',"humidity": '51',"light": '4095'}
    published to topic iotsample/company_name/team_name/data: {"thingId": thingId,"time": 605,"temperature": '21',"humidity": '51',"light": '4095'}
    ...
    ...

Did you get the desired data to send?  If so, great work!!


Helpful Hints for DIY Challenge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- When troubleshooting your code, sometimes you will want to ``import my_script`` again in the same session.  However, if you've already imported that module in a given session, MicroPython will not import it again.  To resolve this::

   >> import sys
   >> del sys.modules['my_script'] #do not include the .py extension
   >> import my_script

- If you lose connection with your device and cannot re-establish it, use Safe Mode boot to re-enable the access point and re-connect to your board: 

1. Power off the device by unplugging the micro usb cable.
2. Press **and hold** the blue button on the device.
3. While continuing to hold the button, power on the device by plugging the micro usb cable back into the device.
4. Carefully watch the STATUS LED, located above the button.
5. When the LED blinks rapidly for 5 seconds, your device has entered **safe boot mode**
6. Release the button
7. Connect to the device AP and WebREPL using the same steps described in section :doc:`../setup/setup`, starting with the section labelled **Connect to Your Device**
